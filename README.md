# GBProtection
A CS:GO Sourcemod server plugin.

This plugin is for knife servers (35hp) but feel free to use it for whatever you want :) If a player kills another player he/she will be unkillable from other players for 1 secound (Takes world damage). This is just a simple plugin no configuration needed. I'm no longer supporting this plugin since I'm not running my server anymore, I just uploaded this here so that people can use it.


### Installation
 - Download "gbprotection.smx" and place it in the plugins folder of your server (csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/).
 - Restart server. If you've done the step above correctly it sould be up and running.
